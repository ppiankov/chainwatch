# Integration strategies

Chainwatch is a runtime control plane for AI agents.
Because agent runtimes differ widely in openness and extensibility,
there is no single universal insertion point.

This directory documents *realistic* integration strategies,
their guarantees, and their trade-offs.

These documents are design investigations, not commitments.
Only one strategy will be implemented first.
