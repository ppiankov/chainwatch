# GitHub Profile Bio Options

Choose one for your GitHub profile:

## Option 1 (Recommended - Technical + Citational)
I build execution-time control systems that prevent irreversible outcomes instead of observing failures after the fact. (Principiis obsta)

## Option 2 (Sharper)
I build software that intervenes before damage occurs, not tools that decorate failures afterward. (Principiis obsta)

## Option 3 (Very Minimal)
Execution control over observability. Prevention over post-mortems. (Principiis obsta)

## Option 4 (Philosophy-first)
Principiis obsta — resist the beginnings. Building intervention-first systems: chainwatch, kubenow, infranow.

All options work. Option 1 is most professional while still being citational.
